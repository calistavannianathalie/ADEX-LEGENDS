                  Cirebon is only one of numerous islands in the New Antillia archipelago. Cirebon is probably the littlest island in the chain, and is most popular as a Leviathan favorable place. Early IMC research bunches were amazed to observe that an enormous populace of neighborhood Leviathans inclined toward the island, and assigned Cirebon as an ethology base to concentrate on the animals' way of behaving. It's been north of a century from that point forward, and keeping in mind that the IMC is gone, the delicate goliaths they concentrated here remain.

It hasn't seen any human movement for most of its activity, yet after its extensive stages gotten the eyes of the Battle Grounds coordinators, it started performing twofold responsibility as a modern mining activity and a site for turbulent battle.

              While taking the Illusion Journey on a drive around through the previous IMC controlled area of interest Kómma on planet Comfort, Delusion failed to keep a grip on the boat and crashed it into a court. Some other individual would have spent the remainder of their life covering the bill for such a bungle, yet since this once flourishing city loaded with betting, clubs, and home to different problematic exercises has turned into a phantom town, Illusion, the Pinnacle Legend he is, hit an arrangement with the current proprietors. With help of the forthcoming Fields matches, Hallucination cleared his obligation by helping to reignite the city and set it back up for life.

              Papua on Olympus is interesting, however it wasn't the first of its sort: the Outlands academic local area needed to test the innovation before it was protected to introduce on Lilian Peck's scholarly heaven. They fabricated an exploration place in a remote segment of Talos where they tried a shortened model of the Papua. It has since a long time ago been deserted, yet the model remaining parts in salvageable shape and practical. Conflicts with responsibility for property has furnished Fields with the rehashed an open door to have matches without disturbance.

                When a straightforward settlement in the world Comfort, the island known as Cupid didn't flourish until the IMC picked it as a center point for innovative work. It housed an airbase, a water treatment plant, and a plenty of different offices to help the IMC's tasks - like an exceptionally ordered project on the capacity of Stage tech, or an extreme program to make a simulacra armed force controlled by a solitary cerebrum. In any case, by all accounts, Cupid appeared to be a basic IMC establishment that, for every one of its flaws, carried solidness and tasks to Comfort.

              An unforgiving planet plagued by extreme volcanic movement, Talos was once considered appalling, and just little luddite settlements flourished there. Be that as it may, it turned into a hotbed of IMC movement when an intriguing mineral compound was found underneath its surface. Heat-diminishing pinnacles were worked to super-cool its normal magma streams and permit asset extraction - the office that housed them was hopefully named "New First light", and the town of World's Edge developed around it.

              When a city based on dreams, Apollo was a perfect world drifting in mists above Psamathe. Here, the most splendid personalities in the Outlands could assemble and trade thoughts, prompting leap forwards in technical disciplines and expressions. Nonetheless, a mishap in an exploratory examination office prompted the production of the Stage Crack (a monstrous air pocket of Stage energy), and the Outlands' ideal and most splendid immediately deserted the city. With the help of the Hired soldier Organization, Hammond Advanced mechanics stepped in to change Olympus into another stage for the Summit Games.
